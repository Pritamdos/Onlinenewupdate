Any request after that will not be entertained. Once you produce the proof of failure, you will get 50 percent amount back. The remaining amount cannot be returned as the writer takes it before starting with the work. However, as a punishment, we blacklist the writer and discontinue with his or her services from immediate basis. Know more about our refund policy in the valid section on the site.

                                Well, honestly speaking, we don't charge for revision unless the client changes the requirements. Revision is completely free of cost. But similar to the refund request, rework is also not entertained after a period of 30 days.

                                As mentioned at multiple places on our website, our writers come from all fields of study and hence can write on any topic under the sun. Our experts have extensive knowledge in their respective subjects and can write on the rarest of rare topics. To confirm, you can speak to our customer support executives or mail us your topic.

                                No! Since we never resell assignments, each of our assignment is written from scratch and is unique in its style, content, referencing and formatting. We believe in the idea of making the students learn through our assignment help materials. Hence, each of the paper is written specific to the individual student’s requirements.

                                This is directly proportional to the subject, topic and the deadline specified by the student. Neither do we hurry in delivering the assignment nor delay. Our writing team works under pressure 24 hours a day 7 days a week just to ensure that the paper reaches the hands of your professors on time. On an average, the papers are completed and delivered between 4 hours and 4-weeks’ time frame based on the deadline set by you.

                                Why not? Don’t we approach private tutors when we get stuck with a complicated chapter or topic? Similarly, if a student needs help in writing an essay, dissertation, thesis or for that matter, any other assignment, they can always approach our writers. See it this way, all students are not born with brilliant minds; they do require some external assistance to excel in academics. In fact, even brilliant minds also require help from tutors if they are busy with part-time jobs or facing time constraint to complete their papers. It’s completely ethical; nothing to worry!

But for this, you need to share with them all the relevant details like exam pattern, types of questions whether it is objective, descriptive or multiple choice questions (MCQ), your login details; and of course, a decent time frame to prepare for the test. Finally, a day before the exam, you need to make the full payment. If the full payment is not received, the expert will not appear for the test.

                                We allow partial payments but only in two installments. The first one i.e. 50 percent of the amount needs to be paid in advance so that the writer can start the work. The remaining 50 percent needs to be cleared before taking the delivery of the paper. 
                                Exceptions can be made for bulk orders worth over 400 USD. In this case, you can make payment in 3-4 installments. But here, we will not do the whole work unless we keep getting the remaining installments. For instance, if you pay us 100 out of 400 USD, we will do 25 percent of the work. Then you need to pay us again so that we can continue with the work.
