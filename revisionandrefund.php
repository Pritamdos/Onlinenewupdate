                                    In case you cancel your current task prior to the assigning of a writer to it, you have the choice to place another assignment order of the same value at no extra cost. That said, in case a writer has already been assigned and work begun on your assignment, you do not have the option to cancel your order. The logic behind is that the writer who has commenced work on your assignment deserves to get paid.

                                 On our part, we always attempt to assign a suitable writer for your assignment. However, in case we fail to find the right writer, we do your next paper of the same monetary value for FREE.

                                When placing your assignment order with us, please ensure that you upload all the document/study materials relevant to the assignment along with the assignment details. In situations in which your assignment is delivered to you post the specified deadline, we will revise and improve on the submitted copy to compensate for the delay and to ensure that your grades are not adversely affected under any circumstances.

                                We have 100% customer satisfaction policy in place, which ensures that our writers will perform multiple reworks on your paper till you are satisfied with the quality and it meets your initial requirements. However, ensure that you raise your rework request within 31 days since the date you placed your order on. Post that time-frame we will not entertain any requests for reworks and neither provide a refund for such cases.

                                  There are next to nothing chances of you getting a fail grade on an assignment delivered by us. But in the extremely rare case when it happens, we assure that you will get a refund of 50% of the total amount paid by you for your assignment. However, for us to do so, you will have to provide genuine proof that you indeed received a fail grade within 31 days since the completion of your assignment by us. After 31 days have elapsed, your request for a refund will not be entertained. 
                                  The reason why only 50% of the total amount is refunded is because we have to pay the writers in advance for your assignment, payment which we cannot take back. That said, to ensure such an incidence is never repeated again, we will terminate the concerned writer.

                                When placing an assignment order with us, you will get 3 categories to choose from – “Pass”, “Credit” and “Distinction.” The overall quality of your assignment will depend on the quality category you choose. The services offered and the price of those services vary according to the category chosen.

                                   In case you get a score lower than the assignment category you booked your assignment for, the differential amount will be refunded to your Wallet account on our website. But before we do that, you will have to provide us with a genuine proof that you indeed received a low score within 31 days of the date of the delivery of your assignment. As in any other case, requests made after 31 days will not be entertained. You can use the refunded amount in your Wallet to purchase future assignments.

                                  We do not offer any cash refund policy (except for the case mentioned in clause #2 in this section). But that only happens if your claim is authentic and has met all of the criteria listed above. For all other cases of proven mistakes on our part, we will provide you with the facility of a free assignment of the same value and not a cash refund. 
                                  Please Note: OnlineAssignmenthelp.com reserves the right to refuse refund or compensatory services if your claim fails to meet the criteria given above.
